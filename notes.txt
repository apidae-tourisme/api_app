# Notes

# Frequent issues
- Uncaught syntax error with "<" token and main.js chunk not loaded : check path strategy and base href in index.html

# Reasons for not using WKWebView for the moment
- Not supported by PouchDB
- Also behaves strangely in regards to web workers
- Still requires a local webserver, which makes pretty much everything more complex to implement
