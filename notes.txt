# Notes

# Frequent issues
- Uncaught syntax error with "<" token and main.js chunk not loaded : check path strategy and base href in index.html

# Reasons for not using WKWebView for the moment
- Not supported by PouchDB
- Also behaves strangely in regards to web workers
- Still requires a local webserver, which makes pretty much everything more complex to implement

# Patched for Promise ES5 compatibility
node_modules/worker-pouch/lib/worker/core.js => var Promise = require('pouchdb-promise').default;
node_modules/worker-pouch/lib/shared/utils.js => var Promise = require('pouchdb-promise').default;
node_modules/pouchdb-browser/lib/index.es.js => comment 'db.type() is deprecated' warning

# PouchDB changes API
the API times out (30 secs) when no changes are detected - this seems to be ok as long as the called URL is the good one
worker-pouch tries to apply the filter locally when getting user changes => remoteDb is kept out of the worker to avoid this
